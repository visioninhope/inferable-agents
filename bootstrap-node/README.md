# Inferable Node.js Bootstrap

This is a Node.js bootstrap application that demonstrates how to integrate and use our SDK. It serves as a reference implementation and starting point for Node.js developers.

## Docs

To follow along with the docs, go to our [quickstart](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/quick-start).

## How to Run

1. Start the local worker machine

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Trigger the Run

```bash
npm run trigger
```

## How it works

The worker machine uses the Inferable Node.js SDK to register the `exec` function with Inferable. This function:
   - Accepts `ls` or `cat` commands with path arguments
   - Only allows accessing paths that start with "./"


## Security

- The `exec` function is restricted to only allow access to files starting with "./"
- The agent is designed to be safe and only perform actions that are relevant to the task
- The constraints are enforced by source code, and cannot be bypassed by the agent
