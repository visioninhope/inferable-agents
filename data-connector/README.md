![Inferable Data Connector](./assets/hero.png)

Inferable Data Connector is a bridge between your data systems and Inferable. Configure your data sources in a json file and start conversing with your data in natural language. Works locally, and in any dockerized environment allowing connection to private resources (DB connection / API endpoints) without exposing them to the public internet.

## Features

- 🔐 **Secure Credential Management**: Your credentials are never exfiltrated outside of the dockerized environment.
- 🌐 **No incoming network access required**: The connector runs inside your network, or in your local machine, and "pulls" instructions from Inferable.
- 🧩 **Extensible**: Adding a new data source is as simple as writing a new connector. See the [Postgres](./src/postgres.ts) connector for an example.
- 🔄 **Adapts to schema changes**: The connector automatically adapts to schema changes by periodically fetching the data system schema. (Table definitions, API definitions, etc.)
- 🤿 **Optional Privacy Mode**: Query outputs are never sent to the model. Instead, the function returns results directly to the end user without any model involvement.
- 🔍 **Optional Paranoid Mode**: Adds an additional safety layer by requiring manual approval before executing any query so you can review the query and data before it is executed.

## Connectors

- [x] [Postgres](./src/postgres/postgres.ts)
- [x] [OpenAPI](./src/open-api/open-api.ts)
- [x] [GraphQL](./src/graphql/graphql.ts)
- [x] [MySQL](./src/mysql/mysql.ts)
- [ ] [SQLite](./src/sqlite/sqlite.ts)

## Quick Start

### Running with your own Postgres DB

1. Pull the docker image:

```bash
docker pull inferable/data-connector:latest
```

2. Run the docker container:

```bash
docker run -e INFERABLE_API_SECRET="sk_xxxx" \
           -e POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" \
           -e POSTGRES_SCHEMA="public" \
           --network host \
           inferable/data-connector
```

### Running with a Demo Postgres DB

1. Clone this repository

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Inferable API secret:

```bash
INFERABLE_API_SECRET=your_secret_here

# DEMO POSTGRES CONFIG
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
POSTGRES_SCHEMA=public
```

3. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start a PostgreSQL database with sample data
- Launch the Inferable connector service
- Provide you with a direct link to the Inferable playground where you can start querying

## Sample Data

The demo database comes pre-loaded with sample data (defined in `example_data/seed.ts`). You can use this to experiment with queries and understand how the connector works.

## Configuration

The connector is configured using the [`config.json`](./config.json) file.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "privacyMode": 0,
  "paranoidMode": 0,
  "connectors": [
    {
      "type": "postgres",
      "name": "myPostgres",
      "connectionString": "process.env.POSTGRES_URL",
      "schema": "process.env.POSTGRES_SCHEMA"
    }
  ]
}
```

### config.connectors

Each connector is defined in the `config.connectors` array.

- `config.connectors[].type`: The type of connector. Currently only `postgres` is supported.
- `config.connectors[].name`: The name of the connector. This is the Inferable service name. One will be generated if not provided.

<details>
<summary>Postgres Connector Configuration</summary>

- `config.connectors[].connectionString`: The connection string to your database. (e.g. `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`)
- `config.connectors[].schema`: The schema to use. (e.g. `public`)

</details>

<details>
<summary>OpenAPI Connector Configuration</summary>

- `config.connectors[].specUrl`: The URL to your OpenAPI spec. Must be publicly accessible.
- `config.connectors[].endpoint`: The endpoint to use. (e.g. `https://api.inferable.ai`)
- `config.connectors[].defaultHeaders`: The default headers to use. (e.g. `{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}`)

</details>

<details>
<summary>GraphQL Connector Configuration</summary>

- `config.connectors[].schemaUrl`: The URL to your GraphQL schema. Must be publicly accessible.
- `config.connectors[].endpoint`: The endpoint to use. (e.g. `https://api.inferable.ai`)
- `config.connectors[].defaultHeaders`: The default headers to use. (e.g. `{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}`)

</details>

<details>
<summary>MySQL Connector Configuration</summary>

- `config.connectors[].connectionString`: The connection string to your database. (e.g. `mysql://root:mysql@localhost:3306/mysql`)
- `config.connectors[].schema`: The schema to use. (e.g. `mysql`)

</details>

### config.privacyMode

When enabled (`config.privacyMode=1`), raw data is never sent to the model. Instead:

- The model generates SQL queries based on schema information
- Queries are executed locally
- Only results are returned

Note: This may limit some advanced reasoning capabilities that require direct data access.

### config.paranoidMode

Adds an additional safety layer by requiring manual approval before executing any queries. Enable with `config.paranoidMode=1`. This can get annoying really quickly, so we've disabled it by default.

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production, follow these security best practices:

1. **Read-Only Access**: If you want to prevent any possibility of data mutations, use a read-only database connection string.

2. **Privacy Considerations**:

   - Enable `config.privacyMode=1` if your data security requirements prohibit sharing raw data with the model.
   - The model will still receive metadata (schema, table names, data types)

3. **Query Approval**:

- Set `config.paranoidMode=1` to require manual approval of queries.
- This provides an additional layer of control over database interactions

## Architecture

- All queries execute within the dockerized environment
- Neither the model nor the Inferable Control Plane can execute queries directly
- Database schema information is used to guide query generation

## FAQ

**Q: Can this hallucinate?**
A: Any result generated by an LLM is prone to hallucination. However, we provide two means to mitigate this:

- **Privacy Mode**: Raw data is never sent to the model. Instead, the model generates SQL queries based on schema information.
- **Function results**: Any data received by the model is also visible in the function results in Playground. You can directly verify if the model's output is correct.

**Q: Can the model see my data?**
A: By default, yes, but enabling `config.privacyMode` ensures that only database metadata (schema, table names, data types) is shared with the model.

**Q: Where do the queries execute?**
A: All queries execute within your dockerized environment. Neither the model nor the Inferable Control Plane have direct query execution capabilities.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add support for a new database:

1. Create a new connector file in `src/<connector>.ts`
2. Implement the necessary connection and query interfaces
3. Submit a pull request

We're actively working on adding more data connectors to support various database systems.
